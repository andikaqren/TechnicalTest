# MVVM-Clean-Architecture 

**The MVVM  using Coroutine and Android Jetpack + Hilt.**

## Android Jetpack
* Viewbinding : No need layout tag , Speed and efficiency
* ViewModel : ViewModel objects are automatically retained during configuration changes so that data they hold is immediately available to the next activity or fragment instance
* Coroutines : Simplify code that executes asynchronously
* Room : Room makes it easier to work with databases in Android apps by providing a set of annotations and a high-level API to interact with the database.

## DI
* Hilt: Hilt will generate the Dagger components and the code to automatically inject your Android classes (like activities and fragments) , so its more efficient than Dagger2

### Http
* Retrofit2: Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java by Square, Inc
